Unfortunately, we couldn't stick to tests driven development, most of the tests were 
written after implementation. Also, we didn't fulfil all the set deadlines in
time, but fortunately, we set them with a margin for error. As a result, we
would be able to submit the project in time. However, the postponing of the
deadline definitely helped us to perfect the final outcome. Next time we will
definetly write at least the most important tests, before starting any of the
implementation. The problem with the tests being late meant, that fixing of
bugs was more demanding and also more time consuming.
