 There are two modes of working. Basic mode provides you with basic arithmetic operations, factorial, modulo and power. With P\+RO mode you can handle more complicated calculations. You will be able to see the progress of calculations, use trigonometric functions and brackets. The calculator has a minimalistic design in blue hues that will be pleasant to the eye. There is a special button that allows you to switch between these two modes.
